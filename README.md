# Loops--Exercises_for_beginners

<b>Hi everyone</b>

I'm just starting to learn Python and decided to do some tasks using loops.The tasks are short and mostly simple, and I think they can be useful to someone in learning.
Tasks are not mine, I did not invent them! But I would like someone to look at it and say what I am doing wrong and what I can improve.


A separate file contains content for all tasks.
